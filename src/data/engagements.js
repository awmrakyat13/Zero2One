    impactStatement: "Replaced founder-dependent decision-making with a governance system that held across 4 concurrent projects.",
    triggerMoment: "Nikara's founding family had scaled from one residential project to four simultaneous developments in under three years. Growth exposed what informality had hidden — overlapping mandates between site leads, no escalation protocols, and a founder who remained the single point of approval for decisions that should have been routine. Project timelines began slipping not because of execution gaps, but because the organization couldn't make decisions at the speed the business demanded.",
    structuralFrictions: [
      "Decision authority concentrated entirely with the founder, creating a bottleneck across all four project sites",
      "Site leads operated with ambiguous mandates — no clarity on what they owned vs. what required escalation",
      "No governance rhythm: weekly reviews were ad hoc, monthly reporting was inconsistent, and quarterly planning didn't exist",
      "Cross-functional coordination between procurement, construction, and sales happened through informal channels that broke under load",

    impactStatement: "Built a performance architecture that connected warehouse-floor metrics to boardroom strategy for the first time.",
    triggerMoment: "OfficeSmart had operated successfully for two decades on relationships and institutional memory. As the second generation took over, they inherited a business with no performance measurement system, no standardized reporting, and no way to compare efficiency across 12 regional warehouses. The leadership transition surfaced a deeper problem — the organization had grown without building the operating infrastructure to manage that growth. Decisions were made on instinct, not data, and the new leadership had neither the tenure nor the trust to operate that way.",

      "No standardized KPIs across warehouses — each regional head tracked different metrics in different formats",

When the decision was made to expand into two additional states, the existing organizational structure — designed for a single-state operation — began to fracture.
